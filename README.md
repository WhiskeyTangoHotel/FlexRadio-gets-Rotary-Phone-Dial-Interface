# FlexRadio-gets-Rotary-Phone-Dial-Interface

 Mmonitor a FT232RL FTDI USB to RS232 Converter to detect pulses from the rotary dial phone.  
 Those pulse are interpreted as numbers to build a frequency for the FlexRadio to tune to.   
 After the frequency is "dial in" the Python program sends the API command to the rig to change to that frequency.
